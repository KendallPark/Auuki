# Auuki
Auuki is a powerful, no-nonsense app built for hammering out **structured workouts** on a smart trainer, right in your browser. No installs, no dependencies, no slow updates taking from precious training time.

**Key Features**:
* Run Zwift **.ZWO workouts**
* Connect via **Bluetooth** to smart trainers, power meters, heart rate monitors, the moxy monitor, and many more
* Full control with **ERG mode**, **Grade Simulation**, and **Resistance mode**
* Workouts with **Slope-based targets** for realistic effort control
* Record **.FIT activities** in a cross-industry standard
* Recording of native **RR intervals** in the .FIT file
* Built-in structured workouts to get you started
* **Intervals.icu and Strava** integrations for seamless syncing and uploads

Built as a **progressive web app (PWA)**, Auuki is fully browser-based and runs independently. It makes use of some of the most advanced Browser APIs like: Web Bluetooth, Web Serial, and Web Components. The web version is **free and open-source**, keeping everything on your device.
Train anywhere, with full control directly in your browser.

_Status_: Currently working on creating a full suite of Apple platform native apps (iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS).
